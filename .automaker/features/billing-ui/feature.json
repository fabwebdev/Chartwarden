  "description": "Comprehensive Healthcare Billing Dashboard with Claims Management System\n\nBuild a full-featured billing dashboard for healthcare claims that provides list management, filtering, status tracking, and detailed claim inspection capabilities.\n\nCore Features:\n\nClaims List View:\n- Display paginated table of all claims with columns: Claim ID, Patient Name, Date Submitted, Total Amount, Current Status\n- Implement multi-criteria filtering (status, date range, amount range, patient name/ID)\n- Add sortable columns (ascending/descending on all key fields)\n- Include bulk actions support (export selected claims, batch status updates if applicable)\n- Show claim count and total amount summaries\n- Support both pagination and infinite scroll options for dataset navigation\n\nStatus Tracking System:\n- Define claim lifecycle stages: Submitted → Under Review → Approved/Denied → Paid/Closed\n- Implement visual status indicators with consistent color coding (e.g., yellow=pending, green=approved, red=denied, blue=paid)\n- Create timeline or progress bar visualization showing current stage and completed steps\n- Display status change history with timestamps and actor information\n- Support status-based filtering and grouping\n\nDetailed Claim View:\n- Patient information section: Full name, DOB, member ID, contact details\n- Insurance details: Payer name, policy number, group ID, coverage dates\n- Service details table: Date of service, CPT/procedure codes, descriptions, quantities, unit costs, line totals\n- Financial summary: Subtotal, adjustments, patient responsibility, insurance payment, outstanding balance\n- Status history panel: Chronological log of all status changes with dates, times, and responsible parties\n- Document attachments: List of supporting documents (EOBs, medical records, prior authorizations) with view/download capability\n- Notes/comments section: Internal notes and adjudication remarks\n- Payment tracking: Payment date, method, reference number, remittance details\n\nDashboard KPIs and Analytics:\n- Total claims count (overall and by status category)\n- Total dollar amount in each status bucket\n- Approval rate percentage\n- Average processing time per claim\n- Aging report (claims by days outstanding)\n- Top denial reasons (if applicable)\n\nSearch and Navigation:\n- Global search box supporting: Claim ID, Patient Name, Member ID, Date ranges\n- Quick filters for common views (e.g., \"My Claims,\" \"Pending Review,\" \"Denied Claims\")\n- Breadcrumb navigation when drilling into claim details\n- Return to list functionality preserving previous filter/sort state\n\nTechnical Requirements:\n\nData Model:\n- Define Claim object schema including all required fields and relationships\n- Establish Patient, Payer, Service Line, StatusHistory, and Attachment data structures\n- Determine API endpoints needed (GET /claims, GET /claims/:id, GET /claims/:id/history, etc.)\n- Plan for real-time updates using WebSocket, polling, or server-sent events\n\nPerformance Optimization:\n- Implement virtualized scrolling for lists exceeding 100 items\n- Use debounced search and filter inputs\n- Cache frequently accessed claim details\n- Lazy load claim details and attachments\n- Consider backend pagination vs client-side filtering trade-offs\n\nState Management:\n- Choose state management pattern (Redux, Context API, Zustand, etc.)\n- Plan optimistic updates for status changes\n- Handle concurrent edit scenarios\n- Implement proper cache invalidation strategy\n\nUI/UX Considerations:\n- Mobile-responsive layout (minimum tablet support, consider mobile phone constraints)\n- Loading skeletons for all async operations\n- Empty states with helpful messaging\n- Error boundaries and user-friendly error messages\n- Accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)\n- Toast notifications for actions (claim updated, export complete, etc.)\n\nSecurity and Compliance:\n- Verify user authentication and session management\n- Implement role-based access control (if multiple user types exist)\n- Ensure HIPAA compliance for PHI display\n- Audit logging for claim access and modifications\n- Secure handling of document attachments\n\nEdge Cases and Error Handling:\n- No claims available (empty state)\n- API timeout or failure scenarios\n- Invalid claim ID in URL\n- Missing or incomplete claim data\n- Large attachment files\n- Network interruption during data fetch\n- Concurrent updates to same claim\n- Filter combinations returning no results\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Users can view and locate any claim within 3 clicks\n- Dashboard loads initial view in under 2 seconds\n- Search results return in under 1 second\n- All claim details display accurately and completely\n- Status changes reflect in real-time or within 5 seconds\n- Interface remains responsive with datasets of 10,000+ claims\n- Zero PHI data exposure vulnerabilities",

  "description": "HIPAA Compliance Audit and Remediation\n\nConduct a comprehensive security and compliance audit of the application to identify and remediate all gaps in HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance for handling Protected Health Information (PHI).\n\nPHI Data Identification and Classification:\n- Map all PHI data flows: identify every input form, API endpoint, database table, file storage location, and UI component that collects, processes, stores, transmits, or displays PHI\n- Create an inventory of PHI elements (names, SSNs, medical record numbers, dates of birth, diagnosis codes, etc.) with their storage locations\n- Search codebase for potential PHI leakage in logging statements, console outputs, error messages, stack traces, and analytics tracking\n- Verify no PHI appears in URLs, query parameters, or browser local/session storage\n- Audit third-party integrations and vendor data sharing for BAA (Business Associate Agreement) compliance\n- Validate minimum necessary standard: confirm each access point only requests/displays PHI required for its specific function\n- Review data retention policies: verify automated deletion schedules exist for PHI that exceeds retention requirements\n- Check for PHI in development/staging environments and ensure proper anonymization\n\nEncryption Implementation Audit:\n- Verify encryption at rest: confirm all databases, file systems, and storage volumes containing PHI use AES-256 or approved equivalent\n- Test encryption in transit: validate all PHI transmission uses TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites, check for deprecated protocols\n- Audit encryption key management: verify keys are stored in secure key management systems (HSM/KMS), never hardcoded, and have documented rotation schedules\n- Review backup encryption: ensure all backup files containing PHI are encrypted with same standards\n- Check temporary file handling: verify PHI in cache, temp directories, and memory is encrypted or securely cleared\n- Validate mobile/offline storage encryption if applicable\n- Test for plaintext PHI exposure in application memory dumps or swap files\n\nAccess Control and Authentication Review:\n- Map all authentication flows and verify MFA is required for users accessing PHI\n- Audit RBAC implementation: document all roles, verify principle of least privilege, check for overly permissive access grants\n- Review authorization logic: test that users can only access PHI they're authorized for (no horizontal/vertical privilege escalation)\n- Assess password policies: minimum complexity, expiration, history requirements\n- Evaluate session management: verify secure session tokens, appropriate timeout periods (15-30 min idle), secure logout that invalidates sessions\n- Test automatic logoff mechanisms for workstations/applications after inactivity\n- Review emergency access procedures and break-glass protocols\n- Validate unique user identification (no shared credentials)\n\nAudit Logging and Monitoring:\n- Verify comprehensive audit trails capture: user identity, timestamp, action type, PHI accessed, success/failure status\n- Confirm audit logs are tamper-evident (write-once or cryptographically signed)\n- Test that audit logs themselves don't contain unencrypted PHI\n- Validate log retention meets 6-year HIPAA requirement\n- Review audit log review procedures and alerting for suspicious access patterns\n- Check integrity controls: verify checksums, digital signatures, or version control for PHI records\n\nTechnical Safeguards Assessment:\n- Test integrity controls that detect unauthorized PHI modification or destruction\n- Validate transmission security mechanisms (VPN, encryption protocols)\n- Review disaster recovery and emergency mode operations plans\n- Assess physical safeguard integration (workstation security, device controls)\n- Evaluate mobile device management and BYOD policies if applicable\n\nVulnerability and Penetration Testing:\n- Identify security vulnerabilities that could expose PHI (SQL injection, XSS, insecure deserialization, etc.)\n- Test for common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in PHI-handling components\n- Attempt unauthorized PHI access through privilege escalation or session hijacking\n- Review dependency security: scan for known vulnerabilities in libraries/frameworks accessing PHI\n\nDocumentation and Policy Review:\n- Audit existing privacy policies, security policies, and incident response procedures\n- Review Business Associate Agreements with all vendors/subcontractors\n- Verify breach notification procedures align with HIPAA's 60-day requirement\n- Check workforce training documentation and awareness programs\n- Validate risk assessment has been conducted and documented\n\nCompliance Gap Analysis:\n- Categorize findings by HIPAA Security Rule category: Administrative, Physical, Technical safeguards\n- Rate each gap by severity: Critical (immediate PHI exposure risk), High (compliance violation), Medium (best practice gap), Low (documentation/process improvement)\n- Cross-reference findings against HIPAA Security Rule requirements (45 CFR §§ 164.302-318)\n- Identify Required vs. Addressable specifications and justify addressable implementation decisions\n\nRemediation Planning:\n- Create prioritized action items with effort estimates and dependencies\n- Develop implementation timeline with milestones for critical/high-priority items within 30/60/90 days\n- Assign ownership and accountability for each remediation task\n- Define acceptance criteria and validation procedures for each fix\n- Estimate resource requirements (developer time, infrastructure costs, tooling needs)\n\nDeliverables:\n- Executive summary with overall compliance status and critical findings\n- Detailed audit report organized by HIPAA Security Rule categories with evidence/screenshots\n- PHI data flow diagrams showing current state\n- Risk register with all identified gaps, severity ratings, and potential impact\n- Prioritized remediation roadmap with timeline and resource allocation\n- Updated security policies and PHI handling procedures documentation\n- Testing/validation plan to verify remediation effectiveness\n- Recommendations for ongoing compliance monitoring and periodic re-assessment\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- All Critical and High severity gaps remediated\n- Zero instances of unencrypted PHI in storage or transit\n- Comprehensive audit logging operational for all PHI access\n- All technical safeguards meet or exceed HIPAA Security Rule standards\n- Documentation package ready for OCR (Office for Civil Rights) review if needed",

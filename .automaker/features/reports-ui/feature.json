  "description": "Comprehensive Reports Interface with Multi-Format Export\n\nBuild a full-featured reports module that enables users to select report types, apply filters, preview results, and download reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel/CSV, JSON).\n\nCore Features:\n- Report type selector displaying all available report categories with descriptions\n- Dynamic filter panel that adapts based on selected report type\n  - Date range picker (single date, range, or predefined periods)\n  - Multi-select dropdowns for categories and status\n  - Text search for specific records\n  - Clear all filters button\n- Format selection with visual icons (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON)\n- Report preview table showing sample data before download\n- Download button with progress indicator during generation\n- Filter persistence: save and restore user's last-used filters per report type\n\nUser Experience:\n- Show loading spinner with progress percentage during generation\n- Display estimated time for large reports\n- Provide clear error messages for validation failures, timeouts, or generation errors\n- Disable incompatible filters when certain report types are selected\n- Confirm before generating reports that may take significant time\n- Allow cancellation of in-progress report generation\n\nGenerated Report Requirements:\n- Include metadata header: generation timestamp, applied filters, generated by user, report type\n- Add page numbers and total page count (for PDF)\n- Include column headers and proper formatting in all formats\n- Embed company branding/logo where applicable\n\nTechnical Considerations:\n- Implement client-side filter validation before submission\n- Handle large datasets via streaming downloads or chunked generation\n- Set timeout limits (e.g., 5 minutes max) with clear user communication\n- Implement rate limiting to prevent concurrent report spam\n- Cache report generation results temporarily for re-download\n- Track file size limits: warn users before generating oversized reports\n\nEdge Cases:\n- No results matching filter criteria: show empty state with suggestions\n- Partial data availability: indicate incomplete datasets in report\n- Stale cached data: show cache timestamp and refresh option\n- Browser compatibility for file downloads (support major browsers)\n- Network interruption during download: enable resume or regeneration\n- Maximum concurrent reports per user: queue or block with informative message\n\nError Handling:\n- Invalid date ranges: prevent selection and show validation message\n- Backend timeout: notify user and offer to email report when ready\n- Insufficient permissions: display access denied with explanation\n- Format generation failure: fallback to alternative format or raw data\n- File size exceeds limit: prompt user to narrow filters\n\nDependencies Required:\n- Backend REST API endpoints: GET /reports/types, POST /reports/generate, GET /reports/download/:id\n- Report generation service supporting PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON formats\n- File storage system for temporary report caching\n- Authentication/authorization system for access control\n- Frontend date picker, multi-select, and table components\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Users can generate any report type with appropriate filters within 30 seconds for typical datasets\n- All formats download correctly across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge\n- Filter preferences persist across sessions\n- Error states provide actionable guidance\n- Large reports (>10K rows) complete or provide alternative delivery method",

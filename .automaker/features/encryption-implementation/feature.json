  "description": "Implement Comprehensive Data Encryption Strategy\n\nAdd end-to-end encryption to protect sensitive data both when stored in the database (at rest) and during transmission over the network (in transit).\n\nRequirements:\n\nData at Rest (Database Encryption):\n- Implement database-level encryption for all tables containing sensitive data\n- Choose appropriate encryption algorithm (AES-256 recommended)\n- Set up secure key management system for encryption keys\n- Implement key rotation strategy with configurable intervals\n- Ensure encrypted fields remain queryable where necessary (consider deterministic vs probabilistic encryption)\n- Document which tables/columns are encrypted and why\n- Handle encryption/decryption transparently in the application layer\n\nData in Transit (TLS 1.3):\n- Configure web server to enforce TLS 1.3 as minimum protocol version\n- Disable legacy protocols (TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2) and weak cipher suites\n- Obtain and install valid SSL/TLS certificates from trusted CA\n- Set up automatic certificate renewal process\n- Configure HTTP to HTTPS redirects for all endpoints\n- Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers\n- Ensure all API endpoints and external service connections use TLS 1.3\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- Verify encryption doesn't significantly impact performance (benchmark before/after)\n- Update backup and restore procedures to handle encrypted data\n- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)\n- Add monitoring/alerting for certificate expiration\n- Document encryption implementation for security audits\n- Test encryption/decryption functionality across different environments\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- All sensitive data encrypted in database with no plaintext exposure\n- All network traffic uses TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites\n- Security scan confirms no weak protocols or vulnerabilities\n- Application performance remains within acceptable thresholds",

  "description": "Create Comprehensive Care Plan Management System with Goals, Interventions, and Progress Tracking\n\nBuild a healthcare care plan management interface that enables providers to create, track, and evaluate patient care plans through structured goal setting, intervention planning, and systematic progress monitoring.\n\nCore Components:\n\nCare Plan Form Structure:\n- Multi-section form with tabbed or stepped navigation (Overview, Goals, Interventions, Progress)\n- Patient identification header with name, MRN, DOB, and care team assignment\n- Care plan metadata: creation date, start date, review date, next review date, responsible provider\n- Draft vs. finalized status with workflow transitions\n- Comprehensive validation: required fields, date logic, goal-intervention relationships\n- Warning prompts when navigating away from unsaved changes\n\nGoal Management Section:\n- Dynamic goal list with add/remove/reorder capabilities\n- Per-goal fields: title, detailed description, measurable success criteria, target date, priority level (high/medium/low), category/domain (clinical, functional, psychosocial)\n- Goal status lifecycle: draft → active → achieved/revised/discontinued\n- Progress percentage or milestone tracking per goal\n- Timestamped progress updates with free-text notes\n- Goal dependency tracking (if goal B requires goal A completion)\n- Visual status indicators (color-coded badges, progress bars)\n\nIntervention Management Section:\n- Parent-child relationship: interventions explicitly linked to goals\n- Intervention details: intervention name, type/category, detailed description, frequency/schedule, duration, responsible party/discipline, start date, end date\n- Status tracking: planned → in-progress → completed/discontinued\n- Occurrence logging: scheduled vs. actual completion with date/time stamps\n- Supporting documentation: attach protocols, clinical guidelines, patient education materials\n- Ability to associate one intervention with multiple goals\n\nProgress Monitoring Dashboard:\n- Goal-level progress visualization: progress bars, status icons, trend indicators\n- Timeline view showing all progress updates chronologically\n- Progress note entry form: date, author, goal reference, free-text notes, outcome measurements\n- Outcome measurement capture: numeric values with units, qualitative assessments, standardized scales\n- Baseline vs. current comparison view\n- Filterable progress history (by date range, goal, provider)\n- Summary reports: goals achieved, interventions completed, overall plan status\n\nData Persistence and Audit Trail:\n- Auto-save every 30 seconds or after significant field changes\n- Manual save and \"Save as Draft\" options\n- Complete version history: timestamp, user, fields changed, old/new values\n- Read-only view of previous versions with diff highlighting\n- Audit log for care plan finalization, goal status changes, major edits\n- Review and approval workflow for care plan updates\n\nUser Experience Requirements:\n- Responsive layout supporting desktop, tablet, mobile\n- Contextual help icons with tooltips explaining field purposes\n- Field-level validation with inline error messages\n- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast\n- Confirmation modals for: deleting goals/interventions, discontinuing active items, navigating with unsaved changes\n- Loading states and progress indicators for save operations\n- Success/error notifications for user actions\n\nEdge Cases and Business Rules:\n- Empty state handling: care plan with no goals displays prompt to add first goal\n- Prevent goal deletion if progress notes exist; require status change to discontinued instead\n- Allow intervention discontinuation but preserve historical occurrence data\n- Support one-to-many relationships: single goal with multiple interventions\n- Concurrent edit detection: warn users if another provider has modified the care plan\n- Handle future-dated review dates with reminder/notification system\n- Manage care plan expiration: auto-flag plans past review date requiring update\n- Support goal revision workflow: creating new version while maintaining original goal history\n- Validate date logic: target dates must be future dates, end dates after start dates\n- Handle provider reassignment: update responsible party while maintaining original author attribution\n\nTechnical Considerations:\n- Define data schema for goals, interventions, progress notes, and relationships\n- Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback on save failure\n- Plan for offline capability or clear messaging when connectivity lost\n- Consider performance with large care plans (20+ goals, 50+ interventions)\n- Design API endpoints for CRUD operations on care plan entities\n- Implement proper authorization: who can view, edit, finalize, delete care plans\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Provider can create complete care plan with 5+ goals and associated interventions in under 10 minutes\n- All user actions persist correctly with full audit trail\n- Progress tracking updates reflect immediately in dashboard visualizations\n- Zero data loss during auto-save or session interruptions\n- 100% WCAG AA compliance verified through automated and manual testing\n- System handles concurrent editing gracefully without data corruption",

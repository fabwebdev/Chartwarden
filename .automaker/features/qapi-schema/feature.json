  "description": "Create Comprehensive Quality Assurance and Performance Tracking Database Schema\n\nDesign and implement a production-ready database schema to capture, track, and analyze quality assurance metrics and performance improvement initiatives across the organization.\n\nCore Entities:\n\nQuality Metrics Storage:\n- Define tables/collections for tracking key quality indicators including defect rates, test coverage percentages, mean time to resolution (MTTR), customer-reported issues, and automated test results\n- Support flexible metric types with extensible schema to accommodate new KPIs without structural changes\n- Include time-series capabilities with granular timestamp tracking for trend analysis\n- Store metric values with context (product area, environment, release version, team)\n- Add threshold definitions for alerting and SLA tracking\n\nImprovement Initiatives Tracking:\n- Create structure for initiatives with title, description, objectives, and success criteria\n- Track initiative lifecycle (proposed, approved, in-progress, completed, cancelled)\n- Assign ownership with team and individual contributor fields\n- Store timelines with planned vs actual start/completion dates\n- Link to related documentation, tickets, or external project management tools\n\nRelationships and Impact Analysis:\n- Establish many-to-many relationships between metrics and initiatives\n- Track before/after metric snapshots to quantify initiative impact\n- Support initiative dependencies and prerequisite tracking\n- Enable correlation analysis between different metric types\n\nData Organization and Categorization:\n- Product area/component hierarchy for filtering and grouping\n- Severity levels (critical, high, medium, low) with clear definitions\n- Priority rankings for initiatives and defects\n- Team/department assignments with organizational hierarchy support\n- Tags or labels for flexible cross-cutting categorization\n\nTemporal and Historical Tracking:\n- Time-series schema optimized for daily, weekly, monthly aggregations\n- Historical snapshots with configurable retention policies\n- Version tracking for metric definitions as they evolve\n- Audit log for all changes with user attribution and timestamps\n\nQuery Optimization:\n- Define composite indexes for common access patterns (time ranges + category + team)\n- Partial indexes for active/recent data to improve dashboard performance\n- Materialized views or summary tables for expensive aggregations\n- Partition strategy for time-series data to manage growth\n\nData Integrity:\n- Foreign key constraints between related entities\n- Check constraints for valid status transitions and value ranges\n- Unique constraints to prevent duplicate metric recordings\n- Referential integrity for team/user references\n- Required field validation (NOT NULL constraints)\n\nMetadata and Audit Fields:\n- created_at, updated_at timestamps with timezone support\n- created_by, updated_by user references\n- soft_delete flag with deleted_at and deleted_by tracking\n- version number for optimistic locking\n- data_source field to track origin (manual entry, API, automation)\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n- Choose between relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or document (MongoDB) database based on query patterns and scalability needs\n- Define JSON/JSONB fields for flexible metric-specific attributes\n- Include comments/annotations on schema objects for documentation\n- Specify data types with appropriate precision (DECIMAL for percentages, BIGINT for counts)\n- Plan for horizontal scaling with sharding strategy if needed\n\nIntegration and Extensibility:\n- API-friendly structure with consistent ID schemes (UUID vs auto-increment)\n- Webhook/event table for triggering notifications on threshold breaches\n- Import/export schema for bulk data operations\n- Connection points for CI/CD tools, test frameworks, and monitoring systems\n- Support for calculated/derived metrics based on raw data\n\nDeliverables:\n- Complete DDL scripts or schema definition files\n- Entity-relationship diagram (ERD) showing all tables and relationships\n- Data dictionary documenting each field's purpose, constraints, and sample values\n- Index strategy documentation with rationale\n- Sample queries demonstrating common reporting use cases\n- Migration plan for initial deployment and future schema evolution\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Schema supports all identified metric types without requiring structural changes\n- Dashboard queries execute in under 2 seconds for typical time ranges\n- Data integrity maintained through constraints and validation\n- Audit trail provides complete change history\n- Schema can scale to millions of metric data points without performance degradation",

  "description": "Create REST API Routes for User Management with Role-Based Authorization\n\nImplement a complete set of REST API endpoints for managing user accounts with proper authentication and authorization controls.\n\nRequirements:\n- Create CRUD endpoints for user resources:\n  - GET /users - List all users (admin only)\n  - GET /users/:id - Get single user details (admin or self)\n  - POST /users - Create new user (admin only)\n  - PUT/PATCH /users/:id - Update user (admin or self, with different permissions)\n  - DELETE /users/:id - Delete user (admin only)\n- Implement middleware for authentication verification (JWT/session token validation)\n- Add role-based authorization checks (e.g., admin, user roles)\n- Validate request payloads and sanitize inputs\n- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)\n- Include proper error handling with descriptive messages\n- Consider field-level permissions (e.g., users can update their own email but not their role)\n- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse\n- Write API documentation for each endpoint (request/response schemas)\n- Include unit and integration tests for all routes and authorization scenarios\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n- Attempting to delete or modify your own admin account\n- Accessing deleted/inactive user accounts\n- Handling concurrent updates to the same user\n- Password update workflows (require current password verification)",

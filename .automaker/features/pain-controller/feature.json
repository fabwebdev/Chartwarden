  "description": "Implement Pain Assessment Controller with Multi-Scale Support\n\nCreate a backend controller that manages pain assessment data with support for multiple standardized pain measurement scales and provides comprehensive CRUD operations.\n\nRequirements:\n- Support multiple pain assessment scales (e.g., Visual Analog Scale, Numeric Rating Scale, Wong-Baker FACES, FLACC)\n- Implement RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting pain assessments\n- Associate assessments with specific patients and timestamps\n- Validate assessment data according to each scale's specific constraints (e.g., 0-10 range for NRS)\n- Store assessment metadata including assessor identity, assessment date/time, and patient context\n- Handle retrieval of assessment history with filtering by date range, patient, and scale type\n- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for validation failures\n- Ensure data persistence through appropriate database models/repositories\n- Add input sanitization and validation middleware\n- Include proper error handling for edge cases (invalid scale type, missing patient ID, malformed data)\n\nTechnical Considerations:\n- Define clear data models/schemas for each assessment scale\n- Use appropriate validation libraries for input checking\n- Consider pagination for historical assessment queries\n- Implement proper authentication/authorization checks to ensure assessors can only access appropriate patient data\n- Add logging for audit trail purposes\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- All CRUD operations work correctly for each supported assessment scale\n- Invalid inputs are rejected with clear error messages\n- Assessment history can be retrieved and filtered efficiently\n- Data integrity is maintained across all operations",

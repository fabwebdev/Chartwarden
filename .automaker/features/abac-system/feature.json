  "description": "Implement Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) System\n\nBuild a comprehensive ABAC authorization system that dynamically evaluates permissions based on user attributes, resource attributes, and contextual information at runtime.\n\nRequirements:\n- Design an attribute schema defining user attributes (role, department, clearance level, etc.), resource attributes (owner, classification, type, etc.), and context attributes (time, location, IP address, etc.)\n- Create a policy definition language or structure for expressing ABAC rules (e.g., \"allow if user.department == resource.department AND context.time is business_hours\")\n- Implement a policy evaluation engine that processes attributes against defined policies to grant/deny access\n- Build an attribute provider system to fetch attributes from various sources (user database, resource metadata, request context)\n- Support combining multiple policies with conflict resolution (deny-override, permit-override, etc.)\n- Provide caching mechanism for attribute lookups and policy evaluations to minimize performance impact\n- Create an audit logging system to track all access decisions with full attribute context\n- Build administrative interface for managing policies and viewing attribute mappings\n- Include policy testing/simulation tools to validate rules before deployment\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- Missing or null attribute values in evaluation\n- Performance with large policy sets and high request volumes\n- Handling attribute value changes mid-session\n- Circular dependencies in attribute resolution\n- Time-based or temporary attribute values\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Sub-100ms authorization decision latency for typical requests\n- Support for at least 100 concurrent policy evaluations\n- Complete audit trail for compliance requirements\n- Clear policy conflict resolution with predictable outcomes",

  "description": "Implement Real-Time Notification System with Toast Notifications and Notification Center\n\nBuild a comprehensive notification system that displays real-time updates to users through both temporary toast messages and a persistent notification center.\n\nRequirements:\n\nToast Notifications:\n- Display temporary pop-up notifications for immediate user feedback\n- Support multiple notification types (success, error, warning, info)\n- Include auto-dismiss functionality with configurable timeout\n- Allow manual dismissal with close button\n- Stack multiple toasts appropriately without overlap\n- Position toasts consistently (e.g., top-right corner)\n- Animate toast entry and exit smoothly\n\nNotification Center:\n- Create a centralized notification inbox accessible from the UI\n- Display notification history with timestamps\n- Show unread count badge on notification center icon\n- Mark notifications as read/unread\n- Allow individual notification dismissal\n- Support bulk actions (mark all as read, clear all)\n- Persist notification history across sessions\n\nReal-Time Functionality:\n- Establish WebSocket or SSE connection for live updates\n- Handle connection failures and automatic reconnection\n- Queue notifications received while offline\n- Ensure notifications trigger immediately when events occur\n- Handle multiple browser tabs/windows gracefully\n\nTechnical Considerations:\n- Design notification data structure (id, type, message, timestamp, read status, metadata)\n- Implement notification state management\n- Create reusable notification components\n- Add appropriate ARIA labels for accessibility\n- Ensure notifications don't interfere with user workflows\n- Set limits on notification history storage\n- Handle edge cases (network interruptions, rapid notification bursts)\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Users receive notifications within 1 second of event occurrence\n- Toast notifications are visible and dismissible\n- Notification center maintains complete history\n- System handles at least 100 notifications without performance degradation",

  "description": "Configure Production-Ready CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions\n\nImplement a comprehensive continuous integration and deployment system using GitHub Actions that automates code quality checks, testing, building, and deployment across multiple environments.\n\nRequirements:\n\n**Workflow Structure:**\n- Create separate workflow files for CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml) and CD (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)\n- Configure CI to trigger on pull requests and pushes to main/develop branches\n- Configure CD to trigger on merge to main (staging) and on version tags (production)\n\n**Continuous Integration Pipeline:**\n- Run linting and code formatting checks (ESLint, Prettier, or language-specific tools)\n- Execute full test suite (unit, integration, end-to-end tests)\n- Perform security vulnerability scanning\n- Generate code coverage reports and enforce minimum thresholds\n- Run parallel jobs for different test suites to optimize execution time\n- Implement caching for dependencies (npm, pip, maven, etc.) and build artifacts\n\n**Build Process:**\n- Compile/bundle application for target environments\n- Optimize build output (minification, tree-shaking, compression)\n- Generate build artifacts and upload for deployment jobs\n- Validate build artifacts before deployment\n\n**Deployment Configuration:**\n- Set up staging deployment on merge to main branch\n- Set up production deployment on tagged releases (e.g., v*.*.*)\n- Implement deployment approval gates for production\n- Configure environment-specific variables and secrets using GitHub Environments\n- Include rollback strategy or deployment verification steps\n- Add smoke tests post-deployment to verify successful deployment\n\n**Security & Access Control:**\n- Store sensitive credentials (API keys, deployment tokens) in GitHub Secrets\n- Use GitHub Environments for environment-specific secrets and protection rules\n- Configure OIDC for cloud provider authentication (avoid long-lived credentials)\n- Implement least-privilege access for deployment workflows\n\n**Monitoring & Notifications:**\n- Add workflow status badges to README.md\n- Configure Slack/Discord/email notifications for build failures\n- Set up notifications for successful production deployments\n- Include workflow run summaries with test results and coverage\n\n**Branch Protection:**\n- Enable branch protection on main branch requiring status checks to pass\n- Require at least one approval for pull requests\n- Prevent force pushes and deletions\n- Enable \"Require branches to be up to date before merging\"\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Create CONTRIBUTING.md documenting the CI/CD workflow\n- Document how to add/modify workflow steps\n- Explain secret management and how to rotate credentials\n- Provide troubleshooting guide for common workflow failures\n- Document deployment process and rollback procedures\n\n**Performance Optimization:**\n- Implement dependency caching to reduce installation time\n- Use matrix strategy for testing across multiple versions/platforms if needed\n- Configure concurrent job execution where possible\n- Set appropriate timeout limits for jobs\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- CI pipeline completes in under 10 minutes for typical changes\n- Zero manual steps required from code merge to staging deployment\n- Production deployments require manual approval and complete successfully\n- Failed tests automatically block PR merging\n- Build status is visible at a glance via README badges\n- Team receives immediate notification of pipeline failures\n- All secrets are stored securely and never exposed in logs",

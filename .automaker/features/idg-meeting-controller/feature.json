  "description": "Develop IDG Meeting Documentation Controller with Automated CMS 14-Day Compliance Enforcement\n\nBuild a robust controller system that manages Interdisciplinary Group (IDG) meeting documentation lifecycle while automatically enforcing Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) regulatory requirements mandating completion within 14 calendar days of the meeting occurrence.\n\nCore Functionality:\n\nAPI Endpoints:\n- POST /idg-meetings/documentation - Create new meeting documentation\n- GET /idg-meetings/documentation/:id - Retrieve specific documentation\n- PUT /idg-meetings/documentation/:id - Update existing documentation\n- DELETE /idg-meetings/documentation/:id - Remove documentation (with audit trail)\n- GET /idg-meetings/documentation/pending - List all pending documentation with deadline status\n- GET /idg-meetings/documentation/compliance-report - Generate compliance metrics\n\nBusiness Logic Requirements:\n\nDeadline Calculation & Enforcement:\n- Calculate 14-day deadline from meeting date (calendar days, not business days)\n- Use meeting date at 00:00:00 local time as start reference\n- Deadline expires at 23:59:59 on the 14th day\n- Block final submission of documentation after deadline expiration\n- Allow draft saves at any time, but enforce deadline on final submission\n- Display real-time countdown showing days/hours remaining until deadline\n\nValidation Rules:\n- Verify meeting date is not in the future when creating documentation\n- Reject final submissions exceeding 14-day window with specific CMS regulation reference\n- Validate required documentation fields are complete before allowing final submission\n- Check user authorization level before processing any documentation action\n- Prevent modification of meeting date after documentation has been finalized\n\nAlert & Notification System:\n- Trigger notifications at configurable intervals: 10 days, 7 days, 3 days, 1 day, same day\n- Send alerts to assigned documentation owners\n- Escalate to supervisors if documentation remains incomplete at 2 days remaining\n- Include meeting details, patient information (if applicable), and direct link in notifications\n- Support multiple notification channels (email, in-app, SMS)\n\nOverride & Exception Handling:\n- Require supervisor/administrator role for late submission override\n- Mandate justification text (minimum 50 characters) for all overrides\n- Flag overridden submissions distinctly in compliance reports\n- Send automatic notification to compliance team when override is used\n- Limit override capability to specific user roles defined in authorization matrix\n\nAudit & Compliance:\n- Log all actions with timestamp, user ID, and action type (create, update, delete, override)\n- Record IP address and user agent for all documentation operations\n- Track status transitions (draft → submitted → approved → overridden)\n- Maintain immutable audit log that cannot be altered post-creation\n- Generate monthly compliance reports showing:\n  * Total meetings held\n  * On-time completion rate (percentage)\n  * Average completion time\n  * Late submissions with reasons\n  * Override usage statistics\n  * Trend analysis (improving/declining compliance)\n\nTechnical Implementation:\n\nTimezone Handling:\n- Store all timestamps in UTC in database\n- Convert to facility's local timezone for deadline calculations\n- Account for Daylight Saving Time transitions\n- Use facility's configured timezone from organization settings\n- Display all dates/times to users in their local timezone\n\nData Validation:\n- Verify meeting record exists before allowing documentation creation\n- Ensure documentation is not duplicated for the same meeting\n- Validate data integrity for all required CMS documentation fields\n- Check for conflicts if multiple users attempt simultaneous edits\n- Implement optimistic locking to prevent data loss\n\nError Handling:\n- Return HTTP 422 with detailed error message when 14-day deadline exceeded\n- Provide user-friendly messages referencing specific CMS regulation (e.g., \"42 CFR §418.56\")\n- Include days overdue in error response\n- Suggest contacting supervisor for override in error message\n- Log all validation failures for monitoring\n\nEdge Cases & Special Scenarios:\n\nMeeting Date Scenarios:\n- Weekend/Holiday Meetings: 14-day countdown continues regardless of calendar type\n- Backdated Entries: Validate against original meeting date; flag if already non-compliant at creation time\n- Date Corrections: If meeting date changes, recalculate deadline and re-trigger notification schedule\n- Future-Dated Meetings: Prevent documentation creation until meeting date occurs\n\nOperational Scenarios:\n- Bulk Import: Validate each record individually; generate summary report of compliant vs. non-compliant entries\n- System Downtime: Provide administrative grace period extension capability for documented outages\n- Partial Saves: Allow unlimited draft saves; only enforce deadline on final submission action\n- Auto-Save Functionality: Save drafts every 2 minutes without triggering validation\n- Session Timeout: Preserve draft state; warn user if deadline approaching during active session\n\nData Migration:\n- Historical data import should preserve original timestamps\n- Flag legacy records that were non-compliant at time of entry\n- Allow bulk compliance status updates with administrator approval\n\nIntegration Requirements:\n\nRequired System Integrations:\n- Meeting Scheduler: Retrieve meeting dates, attendees, and patient associations\n- Authentication Service: Verify user identity and role-based permissions\n- Authorization Service: Check override privileges and documentation access rights\n- Notification Engine: Queue and deliver multi-channel alerts\n- Audit System: Persist immutable log entries\n- Reporting Service: Aggregate compliance data for dashboards\n\nData Dependencies:\n- User roles and permissions matrix\n- Facility timezone configuration\n- Meeting metadata (date, type, participants)\n- Notification templates and delivery preferences\n- Compliance reporting requirements and schedules\n\nSecurity & Compliance:\n\nAccess Control:\n- Implement role-based access: viewer, editor, approver, administrator\n- Restrict deletion to administrator role only\n- Require documentation owner or supervisor role for updates\n- Audit all access attempts including denied requests\n\nData Privacy:\n- Ensure PHI (Protected Health Information) handling complies with HIPAA\n- Implement field-level encryption for sensitive patient data\n- Redact patient identifiers in audit logs\n- Support data retention policies per regulatory requirements\n\nPerformance Targets:\n- API response time < 200ms for read operations\n- Deadline calculation must complete in < 50ms\n- Support concurrent users: minimum 100 simultaneous documentation editors\n- Notification queue processing: deliver within 5 minutes of trigger event\n- Compliance report generation: complete within 30 seconds for 1 year of data\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Zero documentation submissions accepted after 14-day deadline (without override)\n- 100% of meetings tracked with deadline status visible\n- Automated notifications reduce late submissions by 50% compared to manual tracking\n- Audit trail captures all required data points for CMS compliance reviews\n- Compliance reports generate accurately with < 1% margin of error",

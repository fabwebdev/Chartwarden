  "description": "Implement Analytics Controller for Dashboard Data Retrieval\n\nCreate a backend controller to handle analytics queries and serve aggregated data for dashboard visualizations and reporting features.\n\nRequirements:\n- Design and implement a controller with endpoints for common analytics queries (e.g., user metrics, activity trends, performance statistics)\n- Support flexible date range filtering (daily, weekly, monthly, custom ranges)\n- Implement efficient data aggregation to minimize database load\n- Add query parameter validation and sanitization\n- Return data in a format optimized for dashboard consumption (pre-aggregated, properly structured)\n- Include appropriate error handling for invalid queries or missing data\n- Add pagination or data limits for large result sets\n- Implement caching strategy for frequently requested analytics data\n- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks\n- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of resource-intensive queries\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- Handle queries for date ranges with no data\n- Manage timezone differences in date-based queries\n- Handle concurrent requests for the same analytics data\n- Consider performance impact of complex aggregations\n\nDependencies:\n- Database schema must support efficient analytics queries (indexes on timestamp/date fields)\n- Authentication/authorization middleware must be in place\n- Dashboard frontend requirements should inform API response structure",

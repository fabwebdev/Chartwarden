  "description": "Security Audit and Vulnerability Remediation\n\nPerform a comprehensive security assessment of the application and implement necessary hardening measures to protect against common vulnerabilities and attacks.\n\nRequirements:\n- Conduct thorough security audit covering:\n  * Authentication and authorization mechanisms\n  * Input validation and sanitization\n  * API endpoint security and rate limiting\n  * Dependency vulnerabilities (scan package.json/requirements.txt)\n  * Secrets management and credential storage\n  * CORS and CSP configurations\n  * SQL injection and XSS attack vectors\n  * CSRF protection implementation\n\n- Document findings:\n  * Categorize vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)\n  * Identify affected components and endpoints\n  * Create prioritized remediation plan\n\n- Implement security hardening:\n  * Update vulnerable dependencies to patched versions\n  * Add input validation and output encoding where missing\n  * Implement proper authentication token handling (secure storage, expiration, rotation)\n  * Enable security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options)\n  * Configure Content Security Policy\n  * Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks\n  * Ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit\n  * Remove or secure any exposed debugging endpoints\n\n- Verification:\n  * Re-scan for vulnerabilities after fixes\n  * Test authentication flows for bypass attempts\n  * Verify all high and critical issues are resolved\n  * Document remaining accepted risks if any",

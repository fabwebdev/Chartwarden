  "description": "Create REST API Endpoints for Insurance Eligibility Verification and Coverage Queries\n\nImplement RESTful API routes that enable eligibility verification and coverage information retrieval for insurance providers.\n\nRequirements:\n- Design and implement two primary endpoints:\n  * POST /api/eligibility/verify - Verify patient eligibility with insurance provider\n  * GET /api/coverage/query - Retrieve coverage details for verified patients\n\n- Request/Response specifications:\n  * Define clear request payload schemas (patient demographics, insurance info, etc.)\n  * Return standardized response formats with appropriate HTTP status codes\n  * Include error handling for invalid requests, missing data, and provider timeouts\n\n- Integration considerations:\n  * Integrate with insurance provider APIs or clearinghouse services\n  * Handle authentication/authorization for API access\n  * Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse\n\n- Data validation:\n  * Validate required fields (patient ID, insurance member number, date of birth, etc.)\n  * Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks\n  * Verify insurance policy is active and covers requested services\n\n- Error handling and edge cases:\n  * Handle provider API downtime gracefully\n  * Manage partial data responses\n  * Return meaningful error messages for different failure scenarios\n  * Log failed verification attempts for troubleshooting\n\n- Documentation and testing:\n  * Document API endpoints with request/response examples\n  * Create unit tests for validation logic\n  * Add integration tests for provider communication\n  * Test with various insurance providers and coverage scenarios",

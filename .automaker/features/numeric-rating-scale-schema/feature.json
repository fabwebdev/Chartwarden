  "description": "Create Database Schema for Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) Assessments\n\nDesign and implement a database schema to store patient pain assessments using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10), including metadata about when and by whom each assessment was conducted.\n\nRequirements:\n- Create a table/model for pain assessment records with the following fields:\n  - Pain score (integer, 0-10 range validation)\n  - Timestamp of assessment (datetime, required)\n  - Assessor information (staff/clinician identifier)\n  - Patient identifier (foreign key/reference)\n  - Optional notes/comments field for additional context\n- Add constraints to ensure pain score is within valid range (0-10)\n- Index timestamp field for efficient querying of historical data\n- Include created_at and updated_at audit fields\n- Consider adding assessment method field (patient-reported vs clinician-observed)\n- Define relationships to existing patient and user/staff tables\n- Add unique constraint or logic to prevent duplicate assessments at exact same timestamp for same patient\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n- Handle nullable assessor for patient self-reported scores\n- Support multiple pain locations if needed (consider separate related table)\n- Plan for assessment history/versioning if scores are correctable",

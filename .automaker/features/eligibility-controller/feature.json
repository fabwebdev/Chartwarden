  "description": "Implement Eligibility Verification Controller with Request Management and Status Tracking\n\nCreate a comprehensive controller to handle eligibility verification requests and provide real-time status tracking capabilities for healthcare provider eligibility checks.\n\nRequirements:\n- Design and implement REST API endpoints for eligibility verification operations:\n  - POST endpoint to submit new eligibility verification requests\n  - GET endpoint to retrieve verification status by request ID\n  - GET endpoint to list verification requests with filtering (by status, date range, provider)\n  - PUT/PATCH endpoint to update verification request details if applicable\n\n- Request handling:\n  - Validate incoming request payloads (patient info, insurance details, provider data)\n  - Generate unique tracking IDs for each verification request\n  - Handle synchronous and asynchronous verification flows\n  - Implement proper error handling with meaningful status codes and messages\n\n- Status tracking system:\n  - Define clear status states (e.g., pending, in_progress, completed, failed, expired)\n  - Store verification request data with timestamps and audit trail\n  - Update status as verification progresses through workflow stages\n  - Support status change notifications/webhooks if applicable\n\n- Data management:\n  - Persist verification requests and responses to database\n  - Structure response format with verification results and coverage details\n  - Implement pagination for list endpoints\n  - Add indexing for efficient status queries\n\n- Security and validation:\n  - Authenticate and authorize API requests\n  - Sanitize and validate all input data\n  - Ensure HIPAA compliance for PHI handling\n  - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse\n\n- Testing considerations:\n  - Unit tests for controller methods\n  - Integration tests for API endpoints\n  - Test various eligibility scenarios (active coverage, expired, not found)\n  - Validate error handling paths",

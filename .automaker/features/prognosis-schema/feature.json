  "description": "Create Comprehensive Prognosis Tracking Schema\n\nDesign and implement a database schema to track patient prognosis information, including expected length of hospital stay, disease progression metrics, and relevant clinical indicators.\n\nRequirements:\n- Define data model for prognosis records with temporal tracking capabilities\n- Include expected length of stay field with date range (admission, expected discharge)\n- Capture disease progression status (improving, stable, deteriorating, critical)\n- Store clinical indicators relevant to prognosis (vital signs trends, lab values, functional status scores)\n- Support versioning/history to track how prognosis changes over time\n- Link prognosis data to patient records and specific diagnoses\n- Include metadata fields (created_by, updated_by, timestamp, confidence_level)\n- Define appropriate data types, constraints, and validation rules\n- Consider relationships with existing patient, diagnosis, and treatment tables\n- Ensure schema supports querying for prognosis trends and outcome analysis\n- Document the schema structure with field descriptions and usage guidelines\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- Handling prognosis updates when unexpected complications arise\n- Managing multiple concurrent prognoses for patients with comorbidities\n- Storing uncertain or provisional prognoses with confidence intervals\n- Archiving historical prognosis data while maintaining query performance",

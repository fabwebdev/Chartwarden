  "description": "Create HOPE Assessment Data Entry Form with Structured Sections and Validation\n\nBuild a comprehensive form interface for entering HOPE (Health Outcomes and Patient Experience) assessment data, organized into logical sections with robust validation and error handling.\n\nRequirements:\n- Design multi-section form layout with clear visual separation between sections\n- Implement section-based organization (e.g., Patient Information, Clinical Metrics, Outcome Measures, etc.)\n- Add appropriate input fields for each data point with correct input types (text, number, date, radio, checkbox, dropdown)\n- Implement field-level validation rules:\n  * Required field validation\n  * Format validation (dates, numeric ranges, pattern matching)\n  * Cross-field validation where dependencies exist\n  * Real-time validation feedback with clear error messages\n- Add section completion indicators or progress tracking\n- Enable save/draft functionality to prevent data loss\n- Implement form submission with server-side validation\n- Provide clear success/error feedback after submission\n- Ensure keyboard navigation and accessibility standards (ARIA labels, focus management)\n- Make form responsive across device sizes\n\nConsider:\n- Whether form should support multi-page/wizard format vs single scrollable page\n- Data persistence strategy (auto-save, manual save, session storage)\n- Required vs optional fields based on assessment requirements\n- Integration with existing patient/assessment data systems\n- User permissions and data security requirements",

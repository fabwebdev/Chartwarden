  "description": "Create REST API Endpoints for Staff Management and Profile Operations\n\nDesign and implement a complete set of RESTful API routes to handle staff-related operations and profile data retrieval.\n\nRequirements:\n- Define resource routes following REST conventions (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE)\n- Implement staff CRUD operations:\n  - GET /api/staff - List all staff members with pagination support\n  - GET /api/staff/:id - Retrieve individual staff profile\n  - POST /api/staff - Create new staff member\n  - PUT/PATCH /api/staff/:id - Update staff information\n  - DELETE /api/staff/:id - Remove staff member\n- Add profile query endpoints:\n  - GET /api/staff/:id/profile - Fetch detailed profile information\n  - GET /api/staff/search - Search staff by criteria (name, department, role, etc.)\n- Implement proper HTTP status codes for all responses\n- Add request validation for required fields and data types\n- Include error handling with descriptive messages\n- Add authentication/authorization middleware to protect sensitive operations\n- Document API endpoints with request/response examples\n- Consider filtering, sorting, and pagination for list endpoints\n- Write integration tests for all routes\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- Handle requests for non-existent staff IDs\n- Validate uniqueness constraints (e.g., email, employee ID)\n- Manage partial updates vs full replacements\n- Handle malformed request payloads",

Medication Order Form:\n   - Capture medication name, dosage, route, frequency, and duration\n   - Include prescriber information and timestamp\n   - Support both scheduled and PRN (as-needed) orders\n   - Validate against contraindications and drug interactions\n   - Include allergy checking before order submission\n   - Support order modifications and discontinuation workflow\n\n2. Medication Administration Record (MAR) Form:\n   - Display scheduled medications with administration times\n   - Allow nurses to document administration, including actual time given\n   - Support partial doses and refusal documentation\n   - Capture administration route and site (for injections)\n   - Enable reason codes for missed or delayed doses\n   - Include barcode scanning capability for medication verification\n\n3. Drug Database Reconciliation:\n   - Integrate with external drug database API (e.g., RxNorm, FDA drug database)\n   - Validate medication names against standardized database entries\n   - Display drug monograph information (indications, side effects, interactions)\n   - Flag discrepancies between ordered and database-standard formulations\n   - Support medication reconciliation during admission, transfer, and discharge\n   - Show alternative medications or generic equivalents\n\nTechnical Considerations:\n   - Implement real-time validation to prevent medication errors\n   - Ensure HIPAA compliance for all data handling\n   - Include audit logging for all medication-related actions\n   - Handle offline scenarios with sync capability\n   - Support multi-language drug names where applicable\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n   - All forms pass clinical workflow validation\n   - Zero tolerance for medication ordering errors\n   - Sub-second response time for database lookups\n   - 100% audit trail coverage",

  "description": "Create Comprehensive Medical Body System Assessment Schemas\n\nDesign and implement standardized data schemas for recording clinical assessments across five major body systems: cardiac, endocrine, hematological, integumentary, and respiratory.\n\nRequirements:\n- Define structured schema for each of the five body systems\n- Include relevant clinical data fields for each system:\n  - Cardiac: heart rate, rhythm, sounds, murmurs, peripheral pulses, edema\n  - Endocrine: hormone levels, gland function, metabolism indicators\n  - Hematological: blood counts, clotting factors, anemia indicators\n  - Integumentary: skin color, texture, lesions, wounds, temperature\n  - Respiratory: breath sounds, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, lung capacity\n- Ensure schemas support both normal findings and abnormal observations\n- Include fields for clinical notes and timestamps\n- Validate that data types are appropriate for medical measurements\n- Consider standardized medical terminology and coding systems\n- Support versioning for schema updates over time\n- Ensure compatibility with common medical record formats\n\nDeliverables:\n- Schema definitions for all five body systems\n- Documentation of field definitions and valid value ranges\n- Example data instances for each schema",

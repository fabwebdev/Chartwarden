  "description": "Configure Zustand State Management Architecture\n\nSet up Zustand stores to manage global application state, with a focus on user authentication and shared application context.\n\nRequirements:\n- Create a dedicated authentication store for user session management\n  - Store current user data (profile, permissions, role)\n  - Track authentication status (logged in, logged out, loading)\n  - Include login/logout actions\n  - Handle token storage and retrieval\n  - Implement session persistence across page refreshes\n\n- Create an application context store for shared UI state\n  - Global loading states\n  - Toast/notification messages\n  - Modal/dialog state\n  - Theme preferences\n  - Feature flags or configuration settings\n\n- Implement proper TypeScript types for all store states and actions\n\n- Structure stores for scalability\n  - Use slices pattern if store becomes large\n  - Implement selectors for efficient re-renders\n  - Add middleware for persistence (localStorage/sessionStorage) where appropriate\n  - Consider devtools integration for debugging\n\n- Ensure proper separation of concerns between stores\n\n- Add basic error handling for state updates\n\n- Document store usage patterns for team consistency",

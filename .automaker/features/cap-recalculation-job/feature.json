  "description": "Implement Scheduled Daily Capacity Calculation and Alert System\n\nCreate an automated job that runs daily to calculate capacity metrics and send alerts when limits are approaching or exceeded.\n\nRequirements:\n- Schedule a recurring job to run at a specific time each day (determine optimal time, e.g., end of business day or midnight)\n- Calculate daily capacity metrics based on current data (define specific metrics: resource utilization, quota usage, throughput, etc.)\n- Compare calculated values against predefined thresholds/limits\n- Trigger alerts when capacity approaches warning threshold (e.g., 80%) or exceeds critical threshold (e.g., 95%)\n- Send notifications through appropriate channels (email, SMS, dashboard, Slack, etc.)\n- Log all calculations and alert events for audit trail\n- Handle job failures gracefully with retry logic and error notifications\n- Ensure idempotency to prevent duplicate alerts if job runs multiple times\n- Make thresholds and alert recipients configurable\n- Include relevant context in alerts (current usage, limit, trend data, recommended actions)\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n- What happens if the job fails to run on a given day?\n- How to handle missing or incomplete data during calculations?\n- Should alerts be suppressed on weekends/holidays?\n- How to prevent alert fatigue from repeated notifications?\n\nDependencies:\n- Access to capacity/usage data sources\n- Job scheduling infrastructure (cron, task queue, scheduler service)\n- Notification service integration\n- Configuration management for thresholds and recipients",

  "description": "Create Data Export Interface with Multi-Format Support\n\nBuild a comprehensive data export system that allows users to generate backups and download their records in multiple file formats.\n\nRequirements:\n- Implement export UI with format selection (CSV, JSON, XML, Excel)\n- Add date range filters to export specific time periods\n- Include option to select which data fields/columns to export\n- Support batch export for large datasets with progress indication\n- Generate downloadable files with appropriate MIME types and file extensions\n- Add filename customization with automatic timestamp inclusion\n- Implement server-side export logic to handle data serialization\n- Include error handling for failed exports with user-friendly messages\n- Add export history/log showing past export operations\n- Ensure exported data maintains proper encoding (UTF-8) for special characters\n- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse\n- Add confirmation dialog showing export size before processing\n- Consider memory limits for large exports (streaming vs. in-memory)\n- Ensure sensitive data is properly handled and user has permission to export\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- Empty datasets or no records matching filter criteria\n- Extremely large exports that may timeout\n- Special characters in data that could break file formatting\n- Concurrent export requests from same user\n- Export operations interrupted mid-process",

  "description": "Create Comprehensive Admin Interface for User Management\n\nBuild a complete administrative interface that enables authorized administrators to manage users, assign roles, and configure granular permissions across the system.\n\nRequirements:\n\nUser Management Features:\n- Display paginated, searchable, and filterable list of all users\n- Enable viewing detailed user profiles including account status, creation date, and activity history\n- Provide ability to create, edit, and deactivate/delete user accounts\n- Support bulk operations (e.g., bulk role assignment, bulk status changes)\n- Include user search by username, email, or other identifying attributes\n\nRole Assignment:\n- Display available roles with clear descriptions of their purpose\n- Allow assigning single or multiple roles to users\n- Show current role assignments for each user\n- Enable adding new roles and editing existing role definitions\n- Provide role hierarchy or inheritance if applicable\n\nPermission Configuration:\n- Present granular permissions organized by feature/module\n- Allow configuring which permissions are included in each role\n- Support direct user-level permission overrides when needed\n- Implement permission templates for common access patterns\n- Display effective permissions for users (combined from roles and overrides)\n\nSecurity & Access Control:\n- Restrict admin interface access to users with admin privileges\n- Implement audit logging for all user management actions\n- Require confirmation for destructive operations (delete, revoke critical permissions)\n- Validate permission changes don't lock out all administrators\n\nUser Experience:\n- Design intuitive navigation between user list, role management, and permission settings\n- Provide clear visual feedback for permission states (granted/denied/inherited)\n- Include help text explaining what each permission controls\n- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes\n\nTechnical Considerations:\n- Determine data model for users, roles, and permissions\n- Implement backend API endpoints for CRUD operations\n- Add proper authorization checks on all admin endpoints\n- Consider caching strategy for permission lookups\n- Plan database indexes for efficient user searching and filtering",

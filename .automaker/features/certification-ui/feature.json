  "description": "Implement Healthcare Certification and Benefit Period Management System with Face-to-Face Compliance Tracking\n\nBuild a complete healthcare certification management interface that tracks certification lifecycles, benefit periods, and face-to-face encounter compliance requirements with real-time deadline monitoring and documentation management.\n\nCore Data Model:\n- Design schema for certifications (ID, patient reference, certification type, start/end dates, status, renewal history)\n- Define benefit periods structure (period ID, parent certification, coverage dates, authorization details)\n- Create face-to-face encounters model (encounter date, provider, documentation references, compliance status, recorded timestamp)\n- Establish relationships and foreign key constraints between certifications, benefit periods, and encounters\n- Include audit fields (created by, modified by, timestamps) for compliance tracking\n\nCertification Management:\n- Create certification entry form with required fields (patient, type, dates, authorization number)\n- Implement certification listing with sortable columns (patient name, type, status, start date, end date, compliance)\n- Build certification detail view showing full history, associated benefit periods, and face-to-face requirements\n- Add certification editing with change history logging\n- Support certification renewal workflow that carries forward relevant data\n- Enable certification status transitions (draft → active → expiring → expired → renewed)\n- Implement soft delete with archival for data retention compliance\n\nBenefit Period Management:\n- Create benefit period creation/editing interface linked to parent certification\n- Display benefit periods in chronological timeline view under parent certification\n- Validate benefit period dates fall within certification date range\n- Support gap detection between consecutive benefit periods\n- Handle benefit period extensions and modifications\n- Show coverage status for each period (active, upcoming, completed)\n\nFace-to-Face Requirement Tracking:\n- Implement requirement deadline calculator based on certification rules (e.g., 30/60/90 days from certification start)\n- Create encounter recording form (date, provider name, encounter type, notes, attachments)\n- Build document upload functionality with file type validation (PDF, images) and size limits\n- Display countdown timer showing days until face-to-face deadline\n- Implement color-coded status indicators:\n  - Green: Compliant (encounter recorded before deadline)\n  - Yellow: Warning (deadline approaching within 7-14 days)\n  - Red: Overdue (deadline passed without recorded encounter)\n  - Gray: Not yet required\n- Show compliance status badge on certification cards and lists\n- Allow retroactive encounter recording with timestamp audit trail\n- Validate encounter date is not in the future or before certification start\n\nDashboard and Reporting:\n- Build summary dashboard showing:\n  - Total active certifications count\n  - Certifications expiring within 30/60/90 days\n  - Face-to-face compliance rate percentage\n  - Overdue face-to-face encounters count and list\n  - Recently added/modified certifications\n- Implement filtering by:\n  - Certification status (active, expired, pending, renewed)\n  - Compliance status (compliant, warning, overdue)\n  - Date ranges (start date, end date, encounter date)\n  - Patient/client name or ID\n  - Certification type\n- Add sorting capabilities for all list views\n- Create exportable reports (CSV/PDF) for compliance audits\n\nUser Interface Components:\n- Design hierarchical layout: Certifications (parent) → Benefit Periods (child) → Face-to-Face Requirements (nested)\n- Use expandable/collapsible sections for certification details\n- Implement calendar view option for visualizing certification timelines\n- Add quick action buttons (Edit, Renew, Add Encounter, View Documents)\n- Show inline validation errors with specific guidance\n- Include confirmation modals for delete/archive actions\n- Display loading states for asynchronous operations\n- Implement responsive grid/card layout adapting to screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)\n\nValidation and Business Rules:\n- Prevent end date before start date for certifications and benefit periods\n- Enforce benefit period dates within parent certification date range\n- Validate encounter date is within certification active period\n- Warn when creating overlapping certifications for same patient\n- Require face-to-face encounter before certification end date (configurable grace period)\n- Prevent deletion of certifications with recorded encounters (require archive instead)\n- Validate file uploads meet security requirements (virus scanning, allowed types)\n\nEdge Cases and Error Handling:\n- Handle certifications created without initial benefit period (allow later addition)\n- Support multiple face-to-face encounters per certification (e.g., recertification scenarios)\n- Manage retroactive encounter recording that changes compliance status\n- Process certification renewals while preserving historical data\n- Handle bulk import/update scenarios with validation and rollback\n- Display appropriate messaging when no certifications exist\n- Recover gracefully from failed document uploads\n- Handle timezone differences for encounter dates and deadlines\n- Support concurrent edits with optimistic locking or conflict detection\n\nPerformance and Scalability:\n- Implement pagination for certification lists (default 25-50 per page)\n- Add search functionality with debouncing for patient/certification lookup\n- Optimize queries for compliance status calculations\n- Cache summary statistics with appropriate invalidation\n- Lazy load benefit periods and encounters until certification expanded\n\nSecurity and Compliance:\n- Implement role-based access control (view, create, edit, delete permissions)\n- Log all data modifications for audit trail\n- Encrypt document uploads at rest\n- Validate user permissions before state-changing operations\n- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS/injection attacks\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Users can create and manage complete certification lifecycle in under 2 minutes\n- Compliance status visible at a glance without clicking into details\n- Zero missed face-to-face deadlines due to unclear UI indicators\n- 100% of date validation prevents invalid configurations\n- Dashboard loads and displays summary metrics within 1 second\n- All file uploads complete with progress feedback and error handling",

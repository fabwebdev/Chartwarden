  "description": "Implement ERA (Electronic Remittance Advice) File Processing Schema\n\nDesign and implement a database schema to handle ERA file processing, including payment information capture and reconciliation tracking for healthcare claims remittance.\n\nRequirements:\n- Define core ERA file metadata table (file ID, submission date, payer information, file format version)\n- Create payment transaction table to store individual payment details (claim ID, payment amount, adjustment codes, dates)\n- Implement reconciliation tracking table to link ERA payments with claims and track reconciliation status\n- Add adjustment and remark code reference tables to normalize denial/adjustment reasons\n- Include audit fields (created_at, updated_at, processed_by) for all tables\n- Define relationships and foreign keys between ERA files, payments, and claims\n- Add indexes on frequently queried fields (claim ID, payer ID, payment date, reconciliation status)\n- Support batch processing by tracking file-level totals vs. sum of individual payments\n- Include validation rules for data integrity (payment amounts, required fields, status transitions)\n- Document schema with clear field descriptions and expected data formats\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- Handling multiple payments for the same claim\n- Partial payments and split payments across multiple ERAs\n- Voided or corrected payments\n- Unmatched payments that don't correspond to existing claims\n- ERA file reprocessing and duplicate prevention",

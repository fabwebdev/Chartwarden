  "description": "Database Schema for Nutrition Assessment System\n\nDesign and implement a comprehensive database schema to store patient nutrition assessment data, including dietary restrictions, food preferences, nutritional intake tracking, and overall nutritional status indicators.\n\nRequirements:\n- Create tables/models for dietary restrictions (allergies, intolerances, medical restrictions)\n- Define food preferences structure (likes, dislikes, cultural/religious preferences)\n- Design nutritional intake tracking schema (meals, portions, macronutrients, micronutrients, timestamps)\n- Establish nutritional status fields (BMI, weight history, deficiencies, health markers)\n- Include proper data types, constraints, and validation rules\n- Define relationships between entities (e.g., patient-to-restrictions, intake-to-meals)\n- Add fields for tracking assessment dates and update history\n- Consider extensibility for future metrics or assessment categories\n- Document the schema with clear field descriptions and usage guidelines\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n- Multiple concurrent dietary restrictions\n- Temporary vs. permanent restrictions\n- Evolving preferences over time\n- Bulk intake logging vs. individual meal entries\n- Historical data retention and versioning",

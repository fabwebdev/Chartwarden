  "description": "Implement FLACC Pain Scale Assessment Schema\n\nCreate a structured schema to capture and calculate FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) pain scale assessments for pediatric and non-verbal patients.\n\nRequirements:\n- Define schema for the five FLACC behavioral categories:\n  * Face: Scoring 0-2 (no expression to constant grimace/jaw clenched)\n  * Legs: Scoring 0-2 (normal position to kicked/legs drawn up)\n  * Activity: Scoring 0-2 (lying quietly to arched/rigid/jerking)\n  * Cry: Scoring 0-2 (no cry to steady cry/screams/sobs)\n  * Consolability: Scoring 0-2 (content to difficult to console)\n- Calculate total score (0-10 range) from individual category scores\n- Include metadata fields: patient ID, assessment timestamp, assessor ID\n- Add interpretation guidelines (0=relaxed/comfortable, 1-3=mild discomfort, 4-6=moderate pain, 7-10=severe pain)\n- Store assessment history for tracking pain trends over time\n- Ensure schema supports both pediatric patients and non-verbal adults\n- Include validation rules to ensure scores are within valid ranges\n- Add optional notes field for qualitative observations\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- Patients with limited mobility affecting Legs/Activity scoring\n- Sedated patients where some behaviors may be suppressed\n- Cultural differences in pain expression\n- Baseline behavioral patterns that may affect scoring accuracy",
